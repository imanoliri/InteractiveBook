Welcome to <i>Battle</i>! This is a turn-based tactics game where two or more teams clash on the battlefield. Each team is controlled by a human player, sharing a single PC or tablet, just like a traditional tabletop game. Sharpen your strategy, plan your moves carefully, and outsmart your opponents to claim victory!<br><br>

<strong>Objective</strong><br>
The primary goal is to eliminate all enemy units and be the last team standing. However, players can choose alternate victory conditions, and some maps may suggest unique objectives. Each unit has specific attributes—such as attack, defense, health, and type—that determine its strength and role on the battlefield. Utilize each unit’s abilities wisely to gain the upper hand.<br><br>


<strong>Game Mechanics</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Define rules:</strong> Before starting the game, players should agree on the rules, such as who takes the first turn, whether each team can move all their units in a single turn or if there is a limit, and any special victory conditions.
<li><strong>Select difficulty/deployment level:</strong>  Each level has usually various levels of difficulty from one of the side's perspective. It controls what units are deployed for each team, according to their minimum and maximum "deployment level" shown in the table.
<li><strong>Taking Turns:</strong> Players take turns moving and attacking with each of their units according to their unit type. You can move a unit by either drag-and-dropping it or clicking its current position and then its target. To help plan your moves, you can toggle the networks to see them over the map. Additionally, hovering over a unit will highlight the nodes it can move to or attack, providing a helpful visual hint.
<li><strong>Moving Units:</strong><ul>
    <li>Drag/click a unit to a valid new node or unit.
    <li>If the target is an empty node, your unit moves to occupy it.
    <li>If your target is a friendly unit, they swap places if both can make the move.
    <li>If the target is an enemy unit, combat occurs according to the type of the <u>attacking</u> unit.<br><br>
    </ul>
</ul>

<strong>Unit Attributes:</strong><ul>
    <li><strong>Attack Melee:</strong> How much damage the unit inflicts when attacking in melee combat.
    <li><strong>Attack Range:</strong> How much damage the unit inflicts when shooting.
    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> How many damage points the unit can substract from incoming attacks.
    <li><strong>Health:</strong> The unit's life points. If this reaches 0, the unit is defeated.
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Units can be of type "M" (Melee), "A" (Archer), "S" (Siege), "R" (Monster), "V" (Cavalry) or "F" (Flier), which determine their movement and attack capabilities.<br><br>
</ul>
<strong>Types of Units:</strong><ul>
    <li><strong>Melee Units (M) (red ring):</strong> Move and attack using the Melee Network (solid red lines). If you drag a melee unit to an enemy, a fight is started, where both units take up to 3 turns to attack each other. The attacker strikes first, and the damage dealt is equal to (attack_melee - defense) with a minimum of 1. If the attacker wins, it moves into the defeated enemy's position.
    <li><strong>Archer Units (A) (green ring):</strong> Move using the Melee Network and attacks using both the Melee and the Archer Network (dashed green lines). When dragged to an enemy, an archer performs a single shot, dealing damage equal to (attack_range - defense) with a minimum of 1 without receiving damage in return. Archers can always move 1 node and still shoot. If they move more than that they cannot shoot.
    <li><strong>Siege Units (S) (white ring):</strong> They shoot like archer units but can also use the Siege Network (dashed white lines) and move using the Melee Network. Siege cannot move and shoot.
    <li><strong>Monster Units (R) (lilac ring):</strong> They behave just like melee units, but each time they attack in melee combat, they "eat" 1 health away from their oponent and add it to theirs.
    <li><strong>Cavalry Units (V) (yellow ring):</strong> They behave just like melee units but can also use the Cavalry Network (solid, fine yellow lines). Their first strike on a melee combat has double melee attack.
    <li><strong>Flier Units (F) (blue ring):</strong> Move and attack like melee units but can use both the Melee and the Flier Network (fine curved blue lines). Fliers can move more freely across the battlefield.<br><br>
</ul>


<strong>Strategy</strong><br>
Use melee units to engage directly and gain ground, archers to whittle the enemy down without taking damage and defend hills and choke-points, siege to overcome defensive positions and neutralize priority targets at long distance, monster units to deal with weak enemy units efficiently, cavalry to flank the enemy and perform shock attacks, and fliers for superior mobility. Plan carefully and outmaneuver your opponent to win!
