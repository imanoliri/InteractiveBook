Welcome to the frozen River City! After you return from patrolling the trading routes from the marauding Ice Wolves, you see that River City is under attack.
A massive pack of Ice Wolves are attacking from the frozen plains, as well as a flock of Winter Ravens from the pine forest on the north-west.<br><br>

The garrison of River City is positioned in advantageous positions on the city walls but they are clearly no match for the incoming onslaught.
It might be wiser to retreat to the walls in the east, where the cavalry reinforcements are coming from.<br><br>

Remember, cavalry units inflict double damage on the first attack of their charge.
Try to make your knights to charge at the wolves instead of letting them charge at you!<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: All city guards survive.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: Do not loose control of the western city walls (always have at least one unit on them).
