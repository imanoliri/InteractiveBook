Welcome to the Frozen Tundra! After a hard march through the icy plains, the expedition from the Valley of Dragons
finds an enemy army at the service of the Goddess of Winter.<br><br>

You have time to ready the troops and come up with a plan. The enemy has advantageous positions on top of two hills
and dominate the area with long range siege weapons. Furthermore, fearsome Mountain Giants guard the middle of the army.<br><br>

Use the forest to the right, where neither archers nor siege weapons can hit you, to flank the enemy with your knights and/or Dragon Riders
and take out the siege weapons while your infrantry charges at the center to keep up the pressure.<br><br>

Beware the Mountain Giants, as they are really powerful in direct combat and try to avoid getting stuck with them in melee combat for too long.
Shooting at them safely from a distance and charging them with cavalry when they are about to fall may be wiser.<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: At least one Dragon Rider or Ballista survives.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: All Dragon Riders survive.
