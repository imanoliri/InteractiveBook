Welcome to the Ice Castle! The arduous journey through the realm of the Winter Goddess Freyja culminates here, at her Ice Castle.<br><br>

The expeditionary army of the Valley of Dragons prepares the siege weapons and the scouts survey the stronghold's defenses.
Freyja herself is in the keep, guarded by her feared Varangian Guard in the courtyard and some Mountain Giants.
Archers man the hard ice walls and defensive siege weapons are mounted at the top of the keep.
Additionally some Winter Ravens circle the skies and Ice Wolves patrol the grounds outside.<br><br>

Try to win the siege weapon battle and storm the castle directly! Even reaching the Winter Goddess will prove a difficult fight,
and she is a very powerful mage to deal with!<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: At least one Dragon Rider or Ballista survives.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: One of each kind of unit survives.
