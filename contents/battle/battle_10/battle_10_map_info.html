Welcome to the Evil's Lair! Armed with the knowledge of the prophecy, the sword from the Lady of the Lake and a righteous cause,
the whole order of the Dragon Rider Knights has arrived at the Realm of the Dark God.<br><br>

From your vantage point behind a line of low hills, you survey the battlefield. Two orc garrisons of archers and siege weapons are entrenched in the
routes between the black lakes. Gargoyles circle ominously overhead, and in the north, Dark Dragon Rider reinforcements wait, ready to strike.<br><br>


The battle will test the nerves of even the braves of knights.
You must scale the steep, barren slopes of the wasteland, enduring the fire of the garrisons.
Gargoyles will swoop to challenge you in the skies, and a fierce showdown with the enemy Dark Dragon Riders is inevitable.
You must strike a balance neutralizing the menaces and maintaining speed. If you get too bogged down trying to defeat all enemies you will
suffer too many losses. If you try to just fly through them, you will be striken down.
Guide your insertion team to the heights of Mount Doom (move 5 Dragon Riders to the mouth of the volcano: nodes 1-6) to claim victory.<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: Defeat all enemy Dark Dragon Riders before your insertion team reaches Mount Doom.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: Your insertion team reaches Mount Doom in less than 5 turns.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: The insertion team consists of the five Dragon Riders at the center of your formation (units 46-50). Don't let them fall!
