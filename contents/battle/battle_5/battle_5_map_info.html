Welcome to the Goblin Burrow! The campaign against the goblins is going well but now the hardest challenge awaits: take the fight to the main burrow
and finish the goblin menace once and for all. For this mission, a human army from the Valley of Dragon lead by Dragon Riders has joined
the dwarven forces.<br><br>

You have a big army, but you'll be forced to funnel them into the narrow tunnels, where they will confront the goblins dug in
with siege weapons in defensive positions, and many Trolls.<br><br>

Don't let your foot soldiers face the Trolls without support, as the monsters will make short work of them and barely lose any health!
If you encounter a path that is very well guarded by defensive archers and siege weapons, try another way or attack from multiple tunnels at once.<br><br>

Try to outsmart and outmaneuver the goblins in the laberynth of tunnels and get the upper hand!<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let your Dragon Riders die.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition:  don't let any of your Dragon Riders die.
