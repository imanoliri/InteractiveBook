Welcome to the Goblin Burrow! The campaign against the goblins is going well but now the hardest challenge awaits:
take the fight to the main burrow and finish the goblin menace once and for all. For this mission, a human army from the Valley of Dragons
lead by Dragon Riders has joined the dwarven forces.<br><br>

You have a big army, but you'll be forced to funnel them into the narrow tunnels, where they will confront the goblins dug in
with siege weapons in defensive positions, as well as many Trolls.<br><br>

Don't let your foot soldiers face the Trolls without support, as the monsters will make short work of them and barely lose any health!
If you encounter a path that is very well defended by archers and siege weapons, try another way or attack from multiple tunnels at once.<br><br>

Try to outsmart and outmaneuver the goblins in the laberynth of tunnels and get the upper hand!<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let your Dragon Riders die.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition:  don't let any of your Dragon Riders die.
