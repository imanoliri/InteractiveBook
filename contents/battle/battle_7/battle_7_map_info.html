Winter has settled over the Valley of Dragons, and ice wolves are wreaking havoc. While patrolling the trade routes with your squad of knights, you come across a human trading caravan under attack. Your mission: protect the caravan from the ferocious beasts and escort it safely to River City.<br><br>

You're starting on the far side of the river, while wolves attack from all directions. Act quickly to reach the caravan before its guards are overwhelmed.<br><br>

Remember, cavalry units deal double damage on their first attack, so position your knights to charge at the wolves instead of letting the wolves charge at them.<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: Ensure all guards survive.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: Prevent any caravan members from dying.
