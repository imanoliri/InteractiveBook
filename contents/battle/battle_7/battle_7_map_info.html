A harsh, unusual Winter has settled over the Valley of Dragons and Ice Wolves are wreaking havoc on the land.
While patrolling the trade routes with your squad of knights, you stumble upon a human trading caravan under attack.
Your mission: protect the caravan from the ferocious beasts and escort it to the haven of River City.<br><br>


The situation is dire. You and your knights are positioned on the far side of the river, while the wolves launch their attack from all directions.
Time is of the essence â€”cross the river swiftly to reinforce the caravan before its guards are overwhelmed.<br><br>

Remember, cavalry units inflict double damage on the first attack of their charge.
Try to make your knights to charge at the wolves instead of letting them charge at you!<br><br>

Optional Victory Condition: Ensure all guards survive.<br><br>

Hardcore Victory Condition: Prevent any caravan members from dying.
