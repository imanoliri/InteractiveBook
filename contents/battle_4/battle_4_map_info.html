Welcome to Broken Shard Passage! With the intention to break the stalemate in the war against the goblins, the dwarven army decides to perform daring move â€”a section of the army feints an attack over a chasm, while another traverses the mysterious Broken Shard Passage to surround the distracted enemy and crush them.<br><br>

Nevertheless, the goblins decide that attacking section is inferior to them and respond with a ferocious counterattack! Lead your flanking group (green) through the Broken Shard Passage and defeat the enemy (orange) before they annihilate your brothers (purple)!<br><br>

Use your commanding Dragon Rider to lead the attack of the flanking group (green), while defending the bridges with your engaged group (purple) to avoid being overrun. Beware, for the goblins have Trolls!




Welcome to Castle Tarn! The army of the Evil Lich king have pushed through the ambush of the Dragon Rider Knights in Greystone Pass and threat to enter the peaceful Valley of Dragons.<br><br>

The only thing in their way is Tarn Castle, where you must coordinate the defense between the Dragon Riders, their human allies and even their squires and hold the fort!<br><br>

Use your ballistae in your towers (you will not have them in difficulty level 3) to target the most dangerous enemies, use your knights on the roof of the Keep (light grey) to attack where the enemy is most vulnerable and use you human soldiers try to keep the enemy outside of the castle patio (light brown) and the keep (blue-grey). Beware of the long range of the enemy catapults and also the Lich King, because it can cast deadly ranged and melee magic attacks!<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let any enemy unit inside the Keep.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition: don't let any enemy unit inside the castle patio. Don't loose a single Dragon Rider.
